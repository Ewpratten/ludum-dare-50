# Here lives the code

This directory should contain game code and exported assets. No workfiles please :)


## Directory structure

- `./game_logic`
  - Contains the actual game code
- `./desktop_wrapper`
  - A tiny bit of code to initialize the game and run it
  - Used to improve the speed of the Rust compiler
